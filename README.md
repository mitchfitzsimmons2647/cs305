The Artemis Financial project was one that was a scenario for working on a fincial firms software security. I believe in this project I did a good job understanding what I needed to do, and took time to research the different given vulnerabilities seen throughout the project. The most challenging thing for me in regard to this project was allocating time to learn different aspects of softare security, specifically Checksum Verification. I increased layers of security by understanding the vulernabilties present, and which ones were a present danger, and which ones were unavoidable. As I changed the code I reran Dependency Checks to see if new vulnerabilties existed. From these assignments I'd show future employers that I know how to do these actions and how to apply them. Understanding the basics gives me a foundation to start, while experience in the field gives me the ability to hone my skills.
